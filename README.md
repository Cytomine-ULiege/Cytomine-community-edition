2. Go into the cloned folder: `cd Cytomine-community-edition`.
4. Edit the file `cytomine.template` if you want to change default values (like URLs and/or SMTP setup)
5. Launch the installer. This will create all the folders and files necessary to launch Cytomine with Compose: `sudo docker run -v $(pwd):/install --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --rm -it cytomine/installer:latest deploy -s /install`
